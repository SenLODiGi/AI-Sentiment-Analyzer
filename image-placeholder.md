# Image Placeholder

The `image.png` file should be your profile picture.

## Instructions:
1. Replace `image.png` with your own profile picture
2. Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger
3. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG
4. Square images work best (will be displayed as circle)

## Current Status:
- [ ] Replace with your actual profile image
- [ ] Update the filename in `main.py` if using a different name

The application will use a default SVG avatar if the image file is not found.
